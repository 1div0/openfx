The following examples should be added to the guide.


Circle Drawing Plugin
=====================

Draws a circle ontop of an existing image. Controlled by three parameters, position (2D double), radius (double) and colour (RGBA).

This will illustrate...
   - the coordinate systems in OFX
   - dealing with non-square pixels and render scales
   - dealing with interlacing


Custom Parameter
================
Rewrite the circle drawing plugin so that it has no double parameters, but only a single custom parameter, controlled cvia the UI.

This will illustrate...
    - using custom parameters.
    - openGL overlays


3x3 2D Filter
=============
Does a variety of simple 2D filtering operations using a 3x3 window.

This will illustrate...
   - the get region of interest action


Analysis Plugin
===============
The plugin will find the minumum and maximum value of a given frame in response to a push button, and store the values
into two parameters. During renders it will rescale pixel values so that 'min' is 0 and 'max' is the whitepoint.

This will illustrate...
    - writing to parameters in response to a button press outside of render.


Basic OpenGL Example
==============
Behaviour to be determined.

This will illustrate the basics of rendering in OpenGL
