      <h1 style="text-align: center;">OpenFX : An Open Plug-in API for
2D Visual Effects</h1>
      <h3>OpenFX What Is It</h3>
OpenFX is an open standard for visual effects plug-ins. It allows
plug-ins written to the standard to work on any application that
supports the standard. This avoids the current per application
fragmentation of plug-in development and support, which causes much
heartache to everyone, plug-in developers, application developers and
end users alike<br>
      <h3>OpenFX Aims</h3>
The core aims of OpenFX were established early on, these are...<br>
      <ul>
        <li>to develop
a standard for writing visual effects
plug-ins,</li>
        <li>to develop
that standard with a broad consensus
within the industry,</li>
        <li>have that
standard be vendor and operating system
neutral,</li>
        <li>have that
standard be sufficiently flexible that
it supports a wide range of visual effects systems, from editors to
compositors.</li>
      </ul>
Subsidiary aims
are,<br>
      <ul>
        <li>have the standard be expandable to other areas in the
future, for
example sound plug-ins or image i/o plug-ins,</li>
        <li>have any expansion of the standard be done in such a manner
so
that
hosts can easily support plug-ins using differerent versions of the API,</li>
        <li>have plug-ins written to the standard be tunable to the
host
system
they are running on,</li>
        <li>allow hosts to provide extra custom functionality to
plugins that
wish to use it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">The API </h3>
The first version of the API, 1.0 has been released and the header
files and examples can be downloaded from the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openfx">project's main page</a>.
<br><br>
The 1.0 version lacks many desired features, this
was done so that an
initial simple standard could be set as quickly as possible which
satisfied most needs. For example, methods for dealing with hardware
rendering support have been left until later.<br>
<br>
A C++ support library has been written for the API, which simplifies the 
process of writing plug-ins and makes it much clearer how the API should be used
by hosts and plug-ins alike. This can be downloaded from the project's main page as well.
      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">OpenFX History</h3>
OpenFX grew out of a conversation at <a href="http://www.ibc.org/">IBC</a>
2002 between Bruno
Nicoletti of <a href="http://www.thefoundry.co.uk">The Foundry</a> and
Tom Benoist of <a href="http://www.ifx.com">Interactive Effects</a>. Tom
asked Bruno to
consider making his company's plug-ins work with Tom's visual effects
applications. Bruno's response was a regretful, "We'd love too, but we
have many other applications we need to port, each of them different,
you'll have to wait in line." Tom understood this and said that what
the industry needed was an open standard for plug-ins to get around
these sorts of problems. With this the idea of OpenFX was born.<br>
      <br>
Early in 2003 The Foundry contacted various visual effects developers,
both of plug-ins and applications, and started a mailing list dedicated
to OpenFX. Over the next year or so the mailing list grew to more than
90
people from over 20 organisations and was the main forum of discussion
for
OpenFX. Ideas were mooted, changed, shot down and mooted again. The
main
developer of OpenFX was Bruno Nicoletti, who took the ideas posted on
the
mailing list and refined them into documented working code. He did this
in the time he could spare from his day to day work at The Foundry.<br>
      <br>
Occasional face to face meetings were also held, for example around a
dozen developers got together in an Amsterdam pub during IBC 2003,
where various views were exchanged and beer was drunk.<br>
      <br>
During 2003, a simple example application and several plug-ins were
written by Kevin ('Al') Crate that supported an early version of
OpenFX.
Hedgehog, as it is known, currently languishes and needs to be updated
to support the release version of OpenFX.<br>
      <br>
Eventually, out of this process, OpenFX took final shape in early 2004.
Many application and host developers are now writing to the OpenFX
standard, with the intent of releasing that software in 2004.<br>
      <br>
In May 2004, OpenFX was moved to Source Forge from The Foundry's
website, allowing for a more collaborative development environment. <br>
<br>
Many companies have developed or are now developing plugins and hosts using the API
and real work is being done with them. OFX is a reality in the visual effects industry.
      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">OpenFX Licensing</h3>
The OpenFX standard is currently owned by The Foundry, however they
have
released it under a 'BSD' open source license, which allows anyone to
use it for any purpose without charge. For more details, see the
license at the top of any of the header files. <br>
