This directory contains source to an implementation of an OFX host C++ support library.
This library skins the raw C API with a C++ layer, which is easy to program and abstracts
the base API.

You will need to understand the API to quite an extent to use this support layer.

Documentation :
 is extremely light at the moment. Ask the authors or start a wiki.

Released under a BSD-style licence: see source.

25/06/2007

Major overhaul of the thing,
      - propertys made simpler to use
      - re-namespaced several classes so that anything to do with image effects are
         in the ImageEffect namespace
      - made the host layer do the logic for several Image Effect actions
        - clip preferences
        - regions of interest
      - simplified the function signatures of the actions
      - the 'Host' class now acts as,
         - a factory,
         - a filter for constructed objects,
         - a description of the host application to the plugin.
